# Sign in

The sign in process essentially is a process of acquiring user's signing key from encrypted keychain data. As well as in [Wallet Creation](sign_in.md), we have encapsulated all the tricky actions in our javascript SDK, so all you need to do here is just get your [wallet](../technical-details/key-entities/wallet.md):

```javascript
const wallet = api.wallets.get('foo@bar.com', 'p@ssw0rd')
```

By doing this, you ask SDK to perform such actions:

* Check out actual KDF parameters;
* Calculate `wallet ID` and `wallet key`;
* Get `wallet` by its `id`;
* Decrypt account keys using `wallet key`;
* Return error if wallet is not verified;

As a result, you get a [Wallet](https://tokend.gitlab.io/new-js-sdk/Wallet.html) instance that will contain decrypted keys, so you can start using them for signing requests and transactions.

```javascript
console.log(wallet.id) // => 4aadcd4eb44bb845d828c45dbd68d5d1196c3a182b08cd22f05c56fcf15b153c
console.log(wallet.email) // => foo@bar.com
// seed for signing keypair:
console.log(wallet.secretSeed) // => SAPSZ3ODNFYAESQEPGL72MAXFNL7RQTFBLYDD32DICJHYQNA36LGNGBN
// The account identifier, NOT the PK from signing keypair: 
console.log(wallet.accountId) // => GAIEBMXUPSGW2J5ELJFOY6PR5IWXXJNHIJSDKTDHK76HHRNYRL2QYU4O
```

To start using wallet through SDK, you can do the following:

```javascript
sdk.useWallet(wallet)
```

After this, SDK will automatically sign every request and operations with your signing keys. Subsequently, new account is created. That means that you can provide your new user with all the TokenD functionalities.
